d3-venue-experiments
====================

For my hackNY fellowship demo I did some data visualization of the growth of Skillshare classes. Unfortunately, there wasn't a backend API for this so I used DB dumps I had to remove. So the d3 is in the repo and if you want to see it demo in all it's glory click [here](http://new.livestream.com/hackNYlive/demofest2012/videos/2336896). I demo first.

This app uses Python for data cleaning, D3.js for data visualization, and Flask for serving the application.
